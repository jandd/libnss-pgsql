	* Merged all changes with the debian project that are known. Version
	number is updated to be larger than all current versions of this
	module.

	* Fixed bug where if you used getpwent, then getspnam, then getpwent
	you would end up hanging the application (common perl operation)
	
	* Update autoconf to the best of my ability, which is relatively new
	to me.

2005-05-08	Russell Smith <mr-russ@pws.com.au>
	* Buffer align the groups allocation size, I believe it fixes a crash on Sparc.

	* Fixed bug where empty groups were not being displayed.

2005-05-05	Russell Smith <mr-russ@pws.com.au>
	* Cursor Must put back the last entry if we overflowed the buffer
	  This caused some groups that were large to go missing

	* Now returns the correct ERRNO for buffer too small.

	* Use PQexecParams to stop sql injections where appropriate

2001-09-30  Bret Mogilefsky  <mogul-sysauth-pgsql@gelatinous.com>

	* made config file parsing much more robust; improper
	handling of sscanf was causing many hard-to-debug crashes when
	config files contained blank lines.  changed back to -O2 from -g
	
	* complain when config file contains a line that's not understood
	
	* plugged MANY leaks

	* now _only_ malloc for config directives, or when necessary
	(sql_escape); should be much faster
	
	* added atexit() calls to do db, cfg cleanup
	
	* removed unused functions
	
	* print_err made more usable and added print_msg, which D() now uses
